    description: 'A catburgler has been spotted in the slums of the South Ward. Cindy,
      a human girl reported burgler spoke the words "I am not afraid of the claw-enforcement"
      before running into the alley with a stolen fish in it''s mouth.


      While
      a single thief might not be a large issue we may need to apply some countermeasures
      to these reports of increased criminality to make sure the vermin does not
      spread. '
